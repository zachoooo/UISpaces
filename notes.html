				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p class="align-left major">Genre 1 - UI Working Schedule</p>
        <p class="align-left">My first genre is intended to represent the time I spent at different buildings prior to becoming a student at the University of Idaho. I chose this genre in order to help readers better understand my interaction with the University prior to applying to be a student. My interactions definitely shaped my decision to attend the university. While the genre may seem simple at face value, it should help illustrate the great deal of time I spent working around people and places of great intellectual value. For my next genre, I show a visualization of my path, but that fails to properly convey my exposure to many of the places that I was in completely. The time is also an important factor in this. This genre thus gives a deeper understanding by showing how repeated exposure to these places shaped me and could shape others.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 2 - UI Working Map</p>
        <p class="align-left">My second genre helps to supliment the schedule and allow people to visualize or even potentially take the walk that I did themselves. I chose this genre to further enforce my experiences as an employee of the university.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 3 - Think Tank Photos</p>
        <p class="align-left">My third genre showcases one of the areas where I spend most of my spare time on campus. I chose to showcase this room as I felt it was particularly valuable to me as a student. Whenever I need to focus on my work, I would go there.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 4 - College Schedule in Code</p>
        <p class="align-left">My fourth genre is specifically related to my major which is Computer Science. I used some basic bits of code to create a pie chart showing how I spend my time in the various buildings now as a student.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 5 - Positive Spotify Playlist</p>
        <p class="align-left">My final genre is some of my favorite songs that I would listen to both while I was working for the university and now as a student. The songs are mostly from my favorite two artists and have a generally positive feel to them to help me stay happy and focussed. The songs aren't overly intrusive which helped me get into a good work flow.</p>
