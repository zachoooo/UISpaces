				<h2>Notes</h2>
				<p class="align-left major">Genre 1 - UI Working Schedule</p>
        <p class="align-left">My first genre is intended to represent the time I spent at different buildings prior to becoming a student at the University of Idaho. I chose this genre in order to help readers better understand my interaction with the University prior to applying to be a student. My interactions definitely shaped my decision to attend the university. While the genre may seem simple at face value, it should help illustrate the great deal of time I spent working around people and places of great intellectual value. For my next genre, I show a visualization of my path, but that fails to properly convey my exposure to many of the places that I was in completely. The time is also an important factor in this. This genre thus gives a deeper understanding by showing how repeated exposure to these places shaped me and could shape others. The genre may also convey the amount of hardwork that I was doing day in and day out. The ultimate conclusion that I want people to take away from this genre is that I put a lot of consistent work in as staff member of the university, but that the campus as a whole helps you focus that work into bettering your education and long term success.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 2 - UI Working Map</p>
        <p class="align-left">My second genre helps to supliment the schedule and allow people to visualize or even potentially take the walk that I did themselves. I chose this genre to further enforce my experiences as an employee of the university and to help provide a more clear picture of what I was regularly exposed to on campus. I felt that this was somewhat necessary to add in since I added the schedule. This makes the schedule significantly more concrete and easy to follow. I did this genre this way due to its simplicity. I had been considering doing something like a 3D tour of the campus, but I believed that this wouldn't convey anymore information while also potentially diluting the message that I wanted to focus on here. This genre is effective, because with just one glance, you are able to see the openness and freedom of the campus even in the context of my fairly strict schedule.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 3 - Think Tank Photos</p>
        <p class="align-left">My third genre showcases one of the areas where I spend most of my spare time on campus. I chose to showcase this room as I felt it was particularly valuable to me as a student. Whenever I need to focus on my work, I would go there. This area serves as one of the most clear and direct examples of the spatial rhetoric of the university. It includes all of the messages that I described during my presentation and does it in an aesthetically pleasing manner. I chose to present this genre the way I did so that I could give people the experience of actually walking through this particular space. This genre is effective due to its visual focus. With just one look at the photo gallery, you can better understand how the campus convey inclusivity and stability.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 4 - College Schedule in Code</p>
        <p class="align-left">My fourth genre is specifically related to my major which is Computer Science. I used some basic bits of code to create a pie chart showing how I spend my time in the various buildings now as a student. I chose this genre due to computer science being my major on the University, but I also chose it as a way of comparing and contrasting my time spent as an employee to my time spent now as a student. It's a sort of follow up schedule to show my transition. I chose to do this genre this way as well so that my code could generate further visual elements for the reader. The vast majority of people won't be able to understand code, but I used a particularly simple piece of code that creates a visualization to help ensure that it could be understood by everyone looking at it even if they don't have a background in computer science. While this genre doesn't focus on spatial rhetoric quite as much as the previous genres, it still helps the reader understand my personal growth and thus how the campus environment shaped me into a student.</p>
        <p class="align-left major">Genre 5 - Positive Spotify Playlist</p>
        <p class="align-left">My final genre is some of my favorite songs that I would listen to both while I was working for the university and now as a student. The songs are mostly from my favorite two artists and have a generally positive feel to them to help me stay happy and focussed. The songs aren't overly intrusive which helped me get into a good work flow. In addition to me generally liking the songs, I felt that most of these songs were applicable to spatial rhetoric on campus as well. Many of these songs focus on positivity, relationships, personal growth, and happiness which are all themes particularly important to college students and thus important to the university as a whole. I chose to present the genre the way I did to help keep the presentation flow uninterrupted. If a reader wanted to listen to any of the tracks, they could simply press play. It creates a smooth transition and a good end to the presentation. This genre is effective as a compliment to the other visual elements that I've provided. I feel that this genre helps readers both see and feel the campus similar to a movie soundtrack. The atmosphere of these songs helps mimic and augment the messages of the campus.</p>
